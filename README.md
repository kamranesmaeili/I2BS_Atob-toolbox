# I2BS project: Atob toolbox
The AtoB bearing fault detection and defect tracking toolbox is a multi-layer modular structure capable of automatically detecting and diagnosing a bearing failure.
In this repository, there are two files including the AtoB modules and a demo to illustrate the use of the modules on simulated vibration signals.
"AtoB modules.R" includes all the modules as well as other parameters and tables necessary for the calculations.

## Installing R, RStudio and libraries
In order to use this toolbox you will need to install R language and an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can download and install [R native](https://www.r-project.org/) to support R on your computer, and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) as the preferred IDE for R.
After the installation is completed, you can start using R by opening "Demo.R" in Rstudio and installing libraries using:

```R
install.packages("package name").
```

After successful installation of the libraries you can load them onto R server using:

```R
library("package name").
```
